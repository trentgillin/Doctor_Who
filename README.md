# Doctor_Who
Text analysis of "Doctor Who" scripts

Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to learn more about text analysis in R. Using the tidytext package, I analyze 
several years of "Doctor Who" text scripts.

Overview:
Most of the analysis can be found in the doctor_who.md file. I begin my analysis by showing how I scraped the web to get the data. I then dive into
the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th doctor eras and analyze word counts as well as how positively or negatively a character speaks.
